> ** Shorter text is always easier to read, isn't it!? **

An introductory course to ML where we'll together learn the Basics of Machine Learning,  gain a solid foundation of the biologically-inspired programming paradigm 'Neural Networks' and utilize these to build a running Text_Summarization Model!

## Mentors:
```
Soma Siddhartha @sedherthe
Ganesh Samarth @ganeshsamarth
Prateek Jain @prateekjain2606
```

## Estimated Time in weeks:
12 weeks

## Motivation:
- To create a coherent and fluent summary having only the main points outlined in the document.
- Biggest Incentive: Decrease in reading time!

## Features:
- Given a longer document the program should create a short, accurate and fluent summary from the doc.
- The Summary should also be comprehensive, coherent, readable, useful and most importantly trustworthy!
